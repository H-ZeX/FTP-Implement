/**
 * NOT MT-safe !
 *
 * **should only call start func one time
 * or its behaviour is undefined**
 *
 * @note some data says that epoll_ctl is MT-safe even if use same epollFd
 * I believe this and use epoll_ctl in multi thread
 * for that the session's cmdFd should use EPOLLONESHOT,
 * so when return from session handle (session handle only handle one cmd one time)
 * I need to explicit call epoll_ctl to restart this session cmdFd
 * this means that, if use lock in epoll_ctl, the performance will to low
 * in this case, every session own one thread will better than threadPool
 *
 * @note be careful that after a fd (not mainfd) has its session,
 * it should only be closed at the destructors of session object
 * (when it has no session, (in the openNewSession func), should call closeFileDescriptor);
 * this is important, for that if close the cmdFd before delete
 * the session object or before delete the fd from epollFd,
 * then this new connect may use have a fd whose value is same as this fd
 * this means that this new connect will use a old session,
 * and the session may be deleted when this new connect still alive.
 *
 * @note all thread is block SIGPIPE and SIGINT, except that,
 * when use epoll_wait only SIGPIPE is block
 * for that, the signal may not send to control thread
 * so even if use signal to register the handler, the epoll_wait in control thread
 * may no recv the signal and still wait;
 * so i need to forbid other thread to recv signal except epoll_wait is run
